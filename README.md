# Photon-OpenCV

Photon-OpenCV is a PHP extension conceived to be an incomplete drop-in replacement for GMagick. By using OpenCV as the main backend library for implementing only the functionality used by [Photon](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/photon/), Photon-OpenCV enables greater performance. Supporting more formats natively, allows for greater PHP logic simplification on Photon's side.
